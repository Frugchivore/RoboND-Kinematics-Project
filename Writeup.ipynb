To alleviate that, it is usually preferable in production to use Quaternion to represent the rotation via the vector ${x, y, z, w}$.

    "##### Building the Forward Kinematics:\n",
    "\n",
    "The utils module stores a generic DH Transform as well as the DH table.\n",
    "The method __utils.create_dh_transform(dh_table, alpha, a, d, theta)__ can be used to generate the transforms about each joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the relevant FK code is stored in the forward_kinematics module.\n",
    "We store the forward kinematics into a class \\_ForwardKinematics that builds all the transforms in its constructor.\n",
    "Because this is a costl operation, we keep the class hidden and make it accessible only through the static factory get_forward_kinematics(). This makes it de facto a singleton and allows us to ensure the cost of building the FK transforms is paid only once in the live of the application. This significantly speeds up the FK and IK computations. After a warm up of about 1-2 seconds to instantiate the transforms, calculating FK or IK takes no more than 0.1 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class provides the method __evaluate_transform(self, tf_key, joints_dict, as_array=True)__ to compute a given transform either as Sympy matrix or numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building the Inverse Kinematics:\n",
    "\n",
    "As IK depends on FK, we use the same logic and wrap the IK code into a singleton, \\_InverseKinematics class.\n",
    "This class provides the method __evaluate_pose(self, position, orientation)__, taking a position and orientation as quaternion and returning the joints values for this pose.

    "\n",
    "##### Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the inverse kinematics calculation is correct, the manipulator will follow the path provided very tightly. Error on test data was 0, and the video clearly show that the path and orientations are good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues encountered in the course of the implementation were:\n",
    "- forgetting to import \\__division\\__ from the future package, causing results to be off.\n",
    "- Using numpy objects instead of sympy ones, causing numerical noise. ex. using np.pi instead of sympy.pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, symplifying the transforms did not improve the speed of the FK or IK in any meaningful way. Yet it severely increases the time required to build the transforms initially. A possible reason is that by the time the transforms get evaluated, all symbols have been replaced by their values and they are easy to evaluate. Therefore we do not benefit from the simplified symbolic formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible extensions & improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can see in trajectory_sampler.cpp that the path is calculated using a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree algotithm, provided by MoveIt. The core idea of RRT is rather straightforward, the real difficulty being in the implementation of the collision detection system used to reject nodes in the path. An interesting additional project could be to implement the RRT to construct the manipulators path ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The mouvements of the manipulator are rather slow, it would be interesting to see the impact of a higher joints velocity. A trade will be necessary between faster mouvement and error in the resulting pose. This would be a good opportunity to add a simple controller on top of our IK to help correct the pose and joints values errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be interesting to solve the KR210 IK problem using the algebraic method discussed in J. Craig's Introduction to Robotics. Maybe, using symbolic computation, one might find some patterns that could be reusable to  obtain the IK solution for a spherical wrist robot, from its DH table in a semi-automated fashion.\n"
